# itsRIGHTtime Internal Projects Showcase

> *Note: **itsRIGHTtime** is my upcoming software company, planned for launch before 2030, focused on building innovative internal tools and B2B products across EdTech, Design, and Cybersecurity domains.*

This repository is created to provide an **overview** of the projects I've worked on for **itsRIGHTtime**. Since the actual repositories are private due to organizational policies, this repo serves as a reference to showcase my contributions, thought process, and architecture behind those works.

> **Note**: Some links or references in the project-specific README files may point to internal or private repositories and may not be accessible publicly.  

> However, I’ll be happy to walk you through the source code or any implementation during the interview session upon request.

- Document the purpose, architecture, and use cases for each custom tool, library, or service developed
- Act as a single reference point during interviews
